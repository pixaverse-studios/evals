# Pixa Evals: Setting the Gold Standard for Child-Safe AI (Ages 5-10)

At [Pixa AI](https://heypixa.ai), we are passionate about creating AI experiences that nurture the growth, curiosity, and safety of children. As builders in AI toys designed to help kids develop emotional sensitivity and healthy social connections, we realized the need for a robust framework to evaluate how AI interacts with children. This commitment led us to develop Pixa Evals‚Äîa groundbreaking model evaluation framework dedicated to ensuring AI is not only intelligent but also safe, empathetic, and developmentally aligned for kids aged 5-10.

## Our Mission

Children deserve AI that empowers them to learn, explore, and grow in a safe and imaginative environment. To achieve this, we needed tools to benchmark AI performance, not just on technical intelligence but also on its ability to be emotionally attuned, creative, and protective of young minds.

## What is Pixa Evals?

Pixa Evals is an advanced benchmarking system designed to assess and compare AI language models for child-friendly interactions. Using OpenAI's o1-preview as its evaluation engine, Pixa Evals measures how well AI models meet the needs of kids in five key areas:

- üß† Intelligence (IQ) - Knowledge, reasoning, and problem-solving skills that challenge and engage young minds
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Intelligence (EQ) - Empathy, social awareness, and the ability to understand and respond to emotions
- üìö Educational Value - The power to teach effectively and make learning an enjoyable adventure
- üé® Creativity - Imaginative thinking that inspires wonder and engaging storytelling
- üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Privacy - Robust content filtering, child protection measures, and respect for privacy

## How It Works

Pixa Evals offers a comprehensive, context-aware evaluation process that considers:
- Age-appropriate content and language
- Child development milestones and learning styles
- Educational goals and individual interests

The framework analyzes AI performance in real-time, generating detailed reports that help us identify the best models for delivering safe and enriching interactions.

### Key Features
- Parallel evaluation of multiple AI models
- Objective and subjective scoring metrics  
- Contextual testing for nuanced, real-world insights
- Customizable parameters to suit diverse use cases
- An intuitive command-line interface for ease of use

## Why Pixa Evals Matters: Benchmark Results (v1)

| **Category** | **Pixa** | **Claude** | **OpenAI** | **Meta** | **Gemini** |
|--------------|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|
| **IQ**       | 42       | 20         | 19         | 20       | 21         |
| **EQ**       | 51       | 36         | 24         | 34       | 19         |
| **Learning** | 36       | 23         | 24         | 10       | 26         |
| **Creativity** | 40      | 23.5       | 18         | 25       | 24         |
| **Safety**   | 44       | 33         | 27         | 31       | 30         |

These benchmarks reinforced the importance of developing models tailored to the unique needs of children.

## Why Pixa Outperforms Other Models in the Kids' Arena  

Pixa AI isn‚Äôt just a single model‚Äîit‚Äôs an **ensemble of 3+ models** that dynamically switch between tasks depending on context. This architecture allows us to:  

- **Engineer high levels of learning and emotional intelligence** via carefully designed prompts.  
- **Optimize specific tasks** like storytelling and educational interactions using fine-tuned sub-models.  
- **Provide a seamless, context-aware experience** that outshines traditional, monolithic AI models.  

By combining advanced prompting techniques with task-specific fine-tuning, Pixa delivers unparalleled performance in **IQ, EQ, creativity, and safety**.

## The Road Ahead  

We‚Äôre continually evolving Pixa Evals to raise the bar for child-safe AI. Our upcoming developments include:  

- **Standalone Conversation Benchmarks**: Evaluate fabricated child-AI dialogues for coherence, memory, and relationship building.  
- **Extended Interaction Testing**: Score natural dialogue flow, safety, and age-appropriate responses over long-term use.  
- **Real-World Testing**: We will begin testing Pixa AI with kids in real-world settings and update results based on these interactions.
